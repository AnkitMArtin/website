# Monitoring Datasets

In many cases itâ€™s not enough to [harvest](./harvesting) and [store](./storing) data. You must also monitor the sources of those data, watching for changes. Additions, deletions, new releases, changes in availability such as new paywalls -- these are all important events that affect the integrity of data.

Another aspect of monitoring is the need for a **[Public Record](../public-record)** _-- a shared record of the information that has been published by the plethora of entities on the web._ A key aspect of the public record is to provide a basis for knowing _who_ produced certain information and _when_ they produced it. [Read more about the role of the public record in the Data Together model.](../public-record)
